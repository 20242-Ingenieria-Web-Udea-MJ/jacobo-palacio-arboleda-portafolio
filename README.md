## Project Structure
This project follows Atomic Design, which decomposes components into different parts based on their size:

- Atoms: The smallest components.
- Molecules: An aggregation of atoms.
- Organisms: An aggregation of molecules and atoms.

These components come together to form the pages of the portfolio.

Additionally, the project utilizes TailwindCSS for styling, allowing for a responsive and modern design.
